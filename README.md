- 👋 Hi, I’m @Purple-monkey-monkey
- 👀 I’m interested in building a full-stack web application.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how all of the pieces fit together for that.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a simple project to learn the ropes! I have coding experience from school in R, C++, Java, SQL, some HTML and CSS
- but I'm really looking to learn more about coding for web apps.
- 📫 How to reach me: tbarger922@gmail.com!
